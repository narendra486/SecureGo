- # middleware
- How it works: wrappers around your HTTP handlers to add security checks before your code runs.
- When to use: wrap every route with the baseline, then add CSRF/rate limits/WAF/authZ based on the endpoint.
- What it mitigates: request smuggling of large bodies, header abuse, missing headers, CSRF, brute force/DoS, basic authZ gaps.

## Components
- Baseline
  - `SecurityHeaders`: sets HSTS (when HTTPS), CSP baseline, nosniff, frame deny, referrer/permissions policy to reduce XSS/clickjacking.
  - `RequestID`: injects correlation IDs so you can trace requests.
  - `Recovery`: catches panics and returns safe 500 responses to avoid leaking stack traces.
  - `BodyLimit(maxBytes)`: caps payload size to avoid memory/DoS.
- CSRF
  - `NewCSRF(cfg)` + `EnsureCSRF`/`Middleware`: double-submit cookie + header; blocks state-changing requests without matching token.
  - Use on any cookie-authenticated POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE route.
- Rate limiting
  - `NewIPRateLimit` or `NewKeyRateLimit` + `Middleware`: token bucket to throttle abusive clients (IP or user key).
- WAF
  - `NewWAF(directives)` + `Middleware`: runs Coraza rules (e.g., CRS) to block common injection/XSS/Traversal payloads.
- AuthZ scaffolds
  - `RequireRole`, `RequireOwnership`: simple gates; plug in your role/ownership checker to enforce least privilege.
- Utility
  - `IPFromRequest`: extracts client IP for logging/limits.
